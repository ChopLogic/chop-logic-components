## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Chop Logic, please report it responsibly. To do so:

- Email us at **[dmitrii.suroviagin@gmail.com](mailto:dmitrii.suroviagin@gmail.com)** with details of the vulnerability.
- Include as much information as possible, such as steps to reproduce, affected versions, and potential impact.
- Please allow us a reasonable time to address the issue before making it public.

## Security Best Practices

Although Chop Logic is a React component library and does not handle sensitive data directly, we recommend following
these general security practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Chop Logic and its dependencies to the latest versions.
- **Validate Inputs:** Ensure proper validation and sanitization of data passed to components.
- **Avoid Inline HTML:** Use React's built-in security features to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Follow Least Privilege Principle:** Limit component permissions and access to only what's necessary.

## Handling Security Updates

Security updates and patches will be announced via:

- Our GitHub repository's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/SavouryGin/chop-logic-components/security)

We recommend all users subscribe to notifications to stay informed about important updates.
