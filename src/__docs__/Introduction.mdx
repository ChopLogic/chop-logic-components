# Chop Logic Components

> This library is currently in active development. New components for logical proofs and formula calculations are being added regularly.

## Overview

The **Chop Logic Component Library** is a collection of reusable React components and hooks designed specifically for building interfaces that work with logical proofs and formula calculations. Built with TypeScript and following atomic design principles, this library provides the foundation for consistent, accessible, and maintainable UIs in logical applications.

## Key Features

#### Specialized for Logic Applications

- Components tailored for logical proofs
- Truth table generators (coming soon)
- Proof visualization tools (coming soon)

#### Modern Development Stack

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Atomic design architecture
- Storybook for documentation
- Vite for blazing fast builds

#### Developer Experience

- Fully typed components
- Comprehensive documentation
- Accessibility-first approach
- Customizable styling

## Atomic Design Structure

Our components are organized following atomic design principles:

1. **Atoms** - Basic building blocks, like buttons, icons or labels.
2. **Molecules** - Groups of atoms working together, like inputs or text blocks.
3. **Organisms** - Complex UI sections, like menus, grids or dialogs.
4. **Hooks** - Reusable functions that allow developers to hook into component state and lifecycle features.

## Getting Started

To get started with Chop Logic Components, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install chop-logic-components
# or
yarn add chop-logic-components
```
