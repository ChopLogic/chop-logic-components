# EditableText

The `EditableText` component allows users to seamlessly edit inline content by clicking on it. It transitions from a read-only view to an editable input field.

## Usage

```tsx
import EditableText from 'chop-logic-components';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('John Doe');

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>
        <EditableText value={name} onChange={setName} placeholder="Enter your name" />
      </h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. Accessibility: Always provide a meaningful id and placeholder for better screen reader support
2. User Experience: Use autoSelectTextOnEditMode for fields where users are likely to replace the entire content
3. Multi-line Content: Enable multiline for longer text content like descriptions or comments
4. State Management: Handle the onChange callback to update your application state when text changes
5. Edit Mode Control: Use the isEditMode prop to programmatically control the editing state
6. Read-Only States: Use readOnly when you want to show editable-looking text that cannot be modified

## Props

<Controls />
