# Loader

The `Loader` component provides a collection of animated loading indicators to show progress or pending states in your application. It offers multiple visual styles to match different contexts and use cases.

## Usage

```tsx
import Loader, { LoaderView } from 'chop-logic-components';

const PageLoader = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Content is loading...</h2>
    <Loader view={LoaderView.Circle} />
  </div>
);

export default PageLoader;
```

### When to Use

- When fetching data asynchronously
- During file uploads or processing
- To indicate background tasks are running
- When you need to show a waiting state without blocking UI
- When you want consistent loading indicators across your application

### Accessibility Notes

1. **ARIA Attributes**: The component automatically includes role="status" and aria-live="polite" to announce loading states to screen readers.
2. **Color Contrast**: Ensure your loader has sufficient contrast against its background.
3. **Alternative Text**: For critical loading states, consider adding additional text explanation.
4. **Motion Reduction**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query in your CSS animations.
