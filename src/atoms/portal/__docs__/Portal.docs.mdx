# Portal

The `Portal` component is a helper container for rendering modals, tooltips, popups and other elements on top of the main page. The portal is created dynamically by appending a new `div` to the `document.body`.
The component cleans up by removing the `div` from the DOM when it is unmounted.

### Usage

```tsx
import Portal from 'chop-logic-components';

const MyModalComponent = () => (
  <Portal>
    <div>Hello from portal!</div>
  </Portal>
);

export default MyModalComponent;
```

## Best Practices

1. _Accessibility_: Ensure portal content is properly accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.
2. _Z-index Management_: Coordinate z-index values across portal content to maintain proper layering.
3. _Event Bubbling_: Remember that events from portal content bubble through the React tree, not the DOM tree.
4. _Container Selection_: Use specific container elements when you need precise control over portal placement.
5. _Cleanup_: Portal content is automatically cleaned up when the component unmounts.
6. _Use Cases_: Ideal for modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and any content that needs to escape overflow:hidden or z-index constraints.
