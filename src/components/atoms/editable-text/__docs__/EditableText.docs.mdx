# EditableText

The `EditableText` component allows users to seamlessly edit inline content by clicking on it. It transitions from a read-only view to an editable input field.

## Usage

```tsx
import EditableText from "chop-logic-components";

const UserProfile = () => {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState("John Doe");

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>
        <EditableText value={name} onChange={setName} placeholder="Enter your name" />
      </h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. _Accessibility_: Always provide a meaningful id and placeholder for better screen reader support.
2. _User Experience_: Use autoSelectTextOnEditMode for fields where users are likely to replace the entire content.
3. _Multi-line Content_: Enable multiline for longer text content like descriptions or comments.
4. _State Management_: Handle the onChange callback to update your application state when text changes.
5. _Edit Mode Control_: Use the isEditMode prop to programmatically control the editing state.
6. _Read-Only States_: Use readOnly when you want to show editable-looking text that cannot be modified.
