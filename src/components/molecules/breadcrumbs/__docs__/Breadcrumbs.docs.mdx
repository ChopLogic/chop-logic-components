# Breadcrumbs

The `Breadcrumbs` component provides an accessible navigation aid that helps users understand their current location within a website hierarchy, following W3C accessibility guidelines.

## Usage

```tsx
import Breadcrumbs, { IconName } from "chop-logic-components";

const PageBreadcrumbs = () => (
  <Breadcrumbs
    items={[
      { label: "Home", icon: IconName.Home, link: "/" },
      { label: "Products", link: "/products" },
      { label: "Electronics", link: "/products/electronics" },
      { label: "Smartphones" }, // Current page - no link
    ]}
  />
);
```

## Best Practices

1. _Flexible Navigation_: Mix of linked and non-linked items
2. _Responsive Design_: Adapts to different screen sizes
3. _Accessibility_: Proper semantic structure and screen reader support
4. _Visual Separators_: Icon-based separators that are ignored by screen readers
5. _Icon Support_: Optional icons for enhanced visual context

## Props

<Controls />
