# MultiSelect

A multi-selection input component that allows users to select multiple options from a dropdown list. Supports search functionality, custom options, and flexible selection management with proper accessibility features.

## Usage

```tsx
import MultiSelect from "chop-logic-components";

const PreferencesForm = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState([]);
  const options = [
    { value: "react", label: "React" },
    { value: "vue", label: "Vue" },
    { value: "angular", label: "Angular" },
  ];

  return <MultiSelect name="frameworks" label="Select preferred frameworks" options={options} onChange={(values) => setSelected(values)} />;
};
```

## Best Practices

1. _Clear Labeling_: Always provide a descriptive label that explains what options are available
2. _Accessibility_: Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for the dropdown and selection items
3. _Option Organization_: Group related options logically and consider alphabetical sorting for long lists
4. _Selection Feedback_: Clearly indicate selected items and provide visual feedback when options are toggled
5. _Search Functionality_: Implement search/filter for lists with more than 10 options to improve usability
6. _Placeholder Text_: Use helpful placeholder text that guides users on what to select
7. _Required Fields_: Mark required fields clearly and provide validation feedback
8. _Disabled States_: Use disabled state appropriately when selection is not currently available
