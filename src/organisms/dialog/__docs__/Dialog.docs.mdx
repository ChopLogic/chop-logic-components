<Meta of={Dialog} title="Dialog" />

# Dialog

The `Dialog` allows you to render a responsive pop-up window with any content. The dialog appearance trigger can be a button or any event on the page. If there are several dialogs, they will appear on top of each other in the order they are called. When adding a dialog, you must think through the conditions for opening and closing it, so props `isOpened` and `onClose` are mandatory.

### Usage

```tsx
import Dialog from 'chop-logic-components';

const ConfirmationDialog = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  return (
    <Dialog isOpened={isOpen} onClose={onClose} title="Confirm Action">
      <p>Are you sure you want to perform this action?</p>
      <div className="dialog-actions">
        <button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>
        <button onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm</button>
      </div>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
```

### Accessibility Notes

_Focus Management_:

- Focus is trapped within the dialog when open
- Focus returns to the triggering element when closed
- Close button is keyboard accessible

_Screen Readers_:

- Announces dialog title when opened
- Announces role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"
- Provides clear close action

_Keyboard Navigation_:

- Escape key closes dialog
- Tab cycles through focusable elements
- Shift+Tab reverses focus order

### Best Practices

_Content Structure_:

- Keep titles concise
- Organize content logically
- Place primary actions on the right
- Include a visible close button

_Behavior_:

- Close on overlay click (optional)
- Prevent body scroll when open
- Consider stacking order for multiple dialogs

_Performance_:

- Load heavy content dynamically
- Consider virtualization for long content
- Memoize dialog contents when appropriate
