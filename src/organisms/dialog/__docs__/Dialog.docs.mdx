<Meta of={Dialog} title="Dialog" />

# Dialog

The `Dialog` allows you to render a responsive pop-up window with any content. The dialog appearance trigger can be a button or any event on the page. If there are several dialogs, they will appear on top of each other in the order they are called. When adding a dialog, you must think through the conditions for opening and closing it, so props `isOpened` and `onClose` are mandatory.

## Usage

```tsx
import Dialog from 'chop-logic-components';

const ConfirmationDialog = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  return (
    <Dialog isOpened={isOpen} onClose={onClose} title="Confirm Action">
      <p>Are you sure you want to perform this action?</p>
      <div className="dialog-actions">
        <button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>
        <button onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm</button>
      </div>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. _Content Structure_:
   - Keep titles concise
   - Organize content logically
   - Place primary actions on the right
2. _User Experience_:
   - Avoid overwhelming users with too much information
   - Use dialogs for critical interactions
   - Provide clear exit options
3. _Performance_:
   - Load heavy content dynamically
   - Consider virtualization for long content
   - Memoize dialog contents when appropriate
4. _Accessibility_:
   - Focus is trapped within the dialog when open
   - Escape key closes dialog
   - Announces role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"
   - Test with screen readers
   - Ensure keyboard-only navigation
   - Use ARIA attributes appropriately
