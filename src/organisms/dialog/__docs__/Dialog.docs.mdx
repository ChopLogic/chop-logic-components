# ChopLogicDialog

The `ChopLogicDialog` allows you to render a pop-up window with any content. The dialog appearance trigger can be a button or any event on the page. If there are several dialogs, they will appear on top of each other in the order they are called. When adding a dialog, you must think through the conditions for opening and closing it, so props `isOpened` and `onClose` are mandatory.

### Usage

```tsx
import ChopLogicDialog from 'chop-logic-components';

const ConfirmationDialog = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  return (
    <ChopLogicDialog
      isOpened={isOpen}
      onClose={onClose}
      title="Confirm Action"
    >
      <p>Are you sure you want to perform this action?</p>
      <div className="dialog-actions">
        <button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>
        <button onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm</button>
      </div>
    </ChopLogicDialog>
  );
};
```

### Accessibility Notes

_Focus Management_:
  - Focus is trapped within the dialog when open
  - Focus returns to the triggering element when closed
  - Close button is keyboard accessible

_Screen Readers_:
  - Announces dialog title when opened
  - Announces role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"
  - Provides clear close action

_Keyboard Navigation_:
  - Escape key closes dialog
  - Tab cycles through focusable elements
  - Shift+Tab reverses focus order

### Best Practices

_Content Structure_:
  - Keep titles concise
  - Organize content logically
  - Place primary actions on the right
  - Include a visible close button

_Behavior_:
  - Close on overlay click (optional)
  - Prevent body scroll when open
  - Consider stacking order for multiple dialogs

_Performance_:
  - Load heavy content dynamically
  - Consider virtualization for long content
  - Memoize dialog contents when appropriate
